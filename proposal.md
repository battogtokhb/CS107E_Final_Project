PROJECT PROPOSAL

Project Title: Lock It, Hack It, Break It
Team Members: Zaya Battogtokh and Josh Wolff

--Description--
We will unlock a standard dial combination padlock. First, we will
unlock the lock using a known combination. Then we will unlock a 
lock where the combination is unknown. We will achieve this with a
brute force technique.

--Hardware--
We will need a stepper motor to turn the lock, a motor driver, a
pull solenoid to open the lock, (maybe) a push solenoid, a pad
lock, and perhaps some type of sensor (like a button) to detect
when the lock has been successfully opened.

--Funds Requested--
Unsure of the total amount. I am currently in Lab64 trying to see
which parts are already available for free. After that, I will likely
check out Jameco.

--Task Breakdown--
Zaya: Configuring and programming a revolution of the stepper 
motor, fine-tuning of stepper motor, programming the algorithm 
for opening a single combination, optimization of the algorithms

Josh: Set up solenoid, programming the shell interface, programming
the sensor that detects when lock is opened, programming the 
algorithm for opening the lock by brute force, optimization

--Goals For Next Week--
Have a device that can open a lock when the combination is known.
