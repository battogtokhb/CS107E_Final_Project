You should be using the github repository for coordinating the work amongst your team. As such, you should be regularly checking in and out code. The final commit of your code must be received by 11:59 pm on Tue June 12.

Create a short writeup about your project and place it in README.md. If you have used code or ideas from other people, please attribute their work. Itâ€™s fine to use code from online, but you must reference where you got the code, and what changes you made. It should be clear what you did, and what others did.

The writeup should also include a short description of what work was performed by each member of the team.
