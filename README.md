You should be using the github repository for coordinating the work amongst your team. As such, you should be regularly checking in and out code. The final commit of your code must be received by 11:59 pm on Tue June 12.

Create a short writeup about your project and place it in README.md. If you have used code or ideas from other people, please attribute their work. Itâ€™s fine to use code from online, but you must reference where you got the code, and what changes you made. It should be clear what you did, and what others did.

The writeup should also include a short description of what work was performed by each member of the team.

**MATERIALS USED**

- 1 x [4-Phase 12VDC 0.4 A Unipolar Stepper Motor](https://bit.ly/2xFiOii)

- 2 x [L298N Motor Drive Controller Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014KMHSW6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

- Additional Stepper Motor obtained from Chris Gregg (unknown model)

- 3D Prints (see details below)

- Generic chain and hook from Home Depot


**3D PRINTS**

The 3D prints used in this project can be found under the directory "3d-stl-files". We used Samy Kamkar's 3D prints for project [Combo Breaker](http://samy.pl/combobreaker/) as a baseline, and we made further personal modifications to fit the scope and physical dimensions of the components in our project. 

**DEMO VIDEO**

See below for a video of the demo. As seen in the video, we were able to configure our stepper motor with code to turn the lock dial to exact combinations. We also set up a mechanism with the second stepper motor with the use of the hook and chain to pull the lock shackle upwards. However, as seen in the video, this was unsuccessful because not enough force (torque) was generated from the stepper motor.
